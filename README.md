# Haven

A modular UI for Home Assistant

![alt text](https://github.com/NilSkilz/haven/tree/master/src/assets/images/mockup.png)

## Intro

Haven was designed to be run on a wallmounted tablet device, and provide a simple but stylish interface with Home Assistant entities.

### haven.json

In order to communicate with Home Assistant you will need to create a long-lived access token which can be generated from your [Account Page](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/) on Home Assistant.

<b>Influx Graphs</b><br>
Graphs are generated directly from Influx, and so this URL is required if you want some nice looking graphs in your UI.

## Modules

Each haven tile has a type, which in turn tells the code which module to load for that tile. The modules should allow for easy development by anyone who wants to create a custom tile. The tile javascript file is loaded into the modules folder, and a config is added to the haven.json file. This includes the schema for the configuration, where you can ask users for information required to configure the tile. <br><br>
Hopefully this approach will allow others to contribute easily to the project.

More documentation will be written in future as this evolves...

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
